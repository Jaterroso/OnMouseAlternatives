# OnMouseAlternatives

Use this Unity Library to workaround issues that arise when deploying a Unity project to a platform that does not support OnMouseDown(), OnMouseDrag() or OnMouseUp() functionality.

Examples of non support are some browsers when deploying in WebGL, console video game consoles, etc.
